    <h1>Welcome to VR Treasures!</h1>
    <h2>about the page</h2>
    <p>So about a month ago from the moment of me creating this page,</p>
    <p>I made a leap of faith into VR, and purchased my first ever VR Goggles</p>
    <p>my choice was almost obvious as it was a spontaneous decision.</p>
    <p>so I went and purchased the Meta Quest 3S</p>
    <p>since then, I was discovering everything I could find and try that caught my attention</p>
    <p>waking up and going through the meta store to see if anything new popped up</p>
    <p>so basically I went full on crazy with VR, you get the gist</p>
    <p>thanks to my newfound lunacy, I found some really cool hidden gems.</p>
    <p>so without any further ado, here are my favourites so far.</p>
    <h1>Favourite games from Meta store:</h1>
    <h2>Free and Beginner friendly:</h2>
    <p>I must start with an obvious one, "First Encounters"
        Now this will work for you only on quest 3 and 3S as the game uses mixed reality.
        Its intuitive and very entertaining, when I downloaded it, my two children and I were playing
        until the headset needed charging. It has very cartoonishly adorable stylized graphics,
        easy and fun controls. Word of warning though, make sure you have plenty of space to move
        to fully enjoy this completely free gem on the Meta Store</p>

    <p>Next up, Ilysia. It is anything but beginner friendly at this stage of development but its worth the time figuring it out.
        I'm an 80s baby, so I had a lot of MMORPG experiences, but this takes the cake.
        Finally, for the first time, you can sink into this open world, VRMMORPG like you did
        in World of Warcraft, except, IT'S IN VR!!! I Know right? Mind in Blown!
        Go check it out, I simply cannot have enough of it</p>

    <p> If you are interested or actually have done any Archery, you going to love this next one.
    "Archery Pro" is a very intuitive archery game where you can challange yourself in single player or against people around the world.
    i have a little archery experience and by my opinion Archery Pro is pretty accurate. I had and still have a ton of fun with the game.
    Check it out and maybe see you around!</p>

    <p>This next one was one of the first games i downloaded on my headset and its so much fun.
       Ironstrike is a fantasy combat game where you use poles, swords and bows to fight golem like enemies in a pretty large open space.</p>
